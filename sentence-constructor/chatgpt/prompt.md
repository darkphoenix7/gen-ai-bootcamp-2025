## Formatting Instructions:

### Vocabulary Table
- The table should only contain verbs, adverbs, nouns and adjectives
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure out the correct particles to use
- The table of vocabulary should only have three columns: Japanese, Romaji and English
- Ensure there are no repeats e.g. miru is repeated twice, show it only once
