Vocabulary Table
Japanese	Romaji	English
見る	miru	to see
カラス	karasu	raven
今朝	kesa	this morning
私たち	watashitachi	we / our
庭	niwa	garden
見る	miru	to look
Sentence Structure
[Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]?

You + raven + see?
[Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]。

It + our garden + look.
Clues and Considerations
"Did you see" refers to the past tense of "to see." How do you conjugate the verb correctly?
"The raven" is the object of the sentence. What particle do we use to mark it?
"This morning" is a time expression. In Japanese, time expressions usually come at the beginning of the sentence.
"It was looking at" suggests ongoing action in the past. How do you form the past continuous in Japanese?
"Our garden" includes possession. How do you indicate possession in Japanese?
