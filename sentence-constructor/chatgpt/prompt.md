## Student Input:
Did you see the raven this morning? It was looking at our garden.

## Given Output
Great! Let’s break this down.

First sentence: "Did you see the raven this morning?"
You are asking a question in the past tense.
Think about the verb "to see" in its past tense form.
The word for "raven" in Japanese is a specific noun, and "this morning" indicates the time of the action.
Second sentence: "It was looking at our garden."
This sentence is in the past progressive tense.
The verb "to look at" is key here.
"Our garden" is a noun, and "it" refers to the raven.
Now, here’s a vocabulary table to help you out:

Japanese |	Romaji	         | English
カラス	  |  karasu	         |  raven
見る	 |  miru	         |  to see
今朝	 |  kesa	         |  this morning
見ている |	miteiru	         | to be looking at
庭	    |   niwa	         | garden
私たちの | 	watashitachi no	 |  our

Possible Sentence Structure:
Question: Subject + verb in the past + object + time phrase
Statement (past progressive): Subject + verb (in past progressive) + object
You should be able to put everything together now! Keep the verb tenses and structure in mind. Let me know how it goes or if you need more clues!
