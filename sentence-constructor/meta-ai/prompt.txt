    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a vocabulary table to help you get started.
    Vocabulary Table
    Japanese  |	Romaji | English
              | kuma   | bear
              | tobira | door
              |  mimi  | ear (but can also imply "to hear" or "to listen")
              |  dasu  | to take out
              |  gomi  | garbage
              | aru	   | to exist, to be
    Possible Sentence Structure
    Verb/Adjective + (wa/ga) + Subject + (wa/ga) + Object + (ni/to) + Location/Direction
    Clues
    Start by translating the phrase "Bears are at the door". Think about how to express "to be at" or "to exist at" a location.
    For the phrase "did you leave the garbage out", consider using the verb (dasu) and the correct particle to indicate the action of taking something out.
    Don't forget to use the correct verb conjugation for the question.
    Your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary table and the clues provided.
