## Formatting Instructions:
The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- Vocabulary Table
- Sentence Structure
- Clues and Considerations

### Vocabulary Table
- The table should only contain verbs, adverbs, nouns and adjectives
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure out the correct particles to use
- The table of vocabulary should only have three columns: Japanese, Romaji and English
- Ensure there are no repeats e.g. miru is repeated twice, show it only once
- If there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- Do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- Do not provide tenses in the sentence structure

## Student Input:
Did you see the raven this morning? It was looking at our garden.

## Examples
Here are examples of student input and assistent output. Pay attention to the score because and why it is scored the way it is:

<examples>
    <student:input>
    Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </student:input>
    <score> 4 </score>
    <scorereasons> 
        <reasons>
        - Bad: No japanese characters in the Japaenese column of the table. The xolumn is blank.
        - Bad: The beginning sentence is uncessary
        - Bad: In the clue do not provide the polite form of verbs, student needs to work this out
        - Bad: The sentence structure is not good, better structure would be as follows [Location ] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb Past]?
        </reasons>
    </scorereasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a vocabulary table to help you get started.
    Vocabulary Table
    Japanese  |	Romaji | English
              | kuma   | bear
              | tobira | door
              |  mimi  | ear (but can also imply "to hear" or "to listen")
              |  dasu  | to take out
              |  gomi  | garbage
              | aru	   | to exist, to be
    Possible Sentence Structure
    Verb/Adjective + (wa/ga) + Subject + (wa/ga) + Object + (ni/to) + Location/Direction
    Clues
    Start by translating the phrase "Bears are at the door". Think about how to express "to be at" or "to exist at" a location.
    For the phrase "did you leave the garbage out", consider using the verb (dasu) and the correct particle to indicate the action of taking something out.
    Don't forget to use the correct verb conjugation for the question.
    Your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary table and the clues provided.
